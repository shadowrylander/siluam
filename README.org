* হ্যালো-এ-লো-এ-লো! Hello-a-lo-a-lo!

My config has been inspired primarily by the configurations of
[[https://alhassy.github.io/emacs.d/index.html][Musa Al-hassy]]
and [[https://github.com/patrickt/emacs][Patrick Thomson]]; it is also a rudimentary version of
[[https://github.com/plexus][Arne Brasseur's]]
[[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs][chemacs]] and [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][chemacs2]].

Okay, I'll be honest with you: my primary config is held [[https://github.com/shadowrylander/damascus][here]];
this is just the ~chemacs~ initialization of it. I figured that, if other people may want to use my work
(which uses my sort-of custom-made ~OREO LICENSE~, based off of the
[[http://www.wtfpl.net/][Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License]]), I might as well not burden them with
the flaws in my own profile, right? As it were, this system is still designed with my config in mind, so you
may find some /funcy/ pieces of code in here as well.
